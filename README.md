# My TODO list application

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

This project is crated for learning purpose. 
In this project I learn how to use 
- loopback.io 
- connecting to mongodb
- create loopback service for todo application that user can:
	- sign up
	- sign in
	- logout
	- show his/her own todo list
	- create new todo
	- edit todo, only the owner of todo can edit
	- set todo to done
- accessong loopback io through angularJS on ionic mobile framework, the ionic part of project
reside on folder client

To run loopback service

```
$ cd <project>
$ npm install
$ node .
```

Ionic Part
This is mobile application part as a client of loopback service. Must used on ionic framework environment.

in this project I use some lib
- ionic angular bundle
- angular-resource
- ionic-material bundle
- angular-moment moment.js

Using this application user can:
- sign up to create account
- sign in
- show todos, only if they has already sign in
- sign out
- create new todo
- edit todo, only his/her own
- delete todo
- set todo to done

On this part. I'm using bower & gulp for managing source.
